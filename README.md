# Horiseon: Landing Page

## Landing Page

This is a copy of the landing page for Horiseon which has been refactored to be more accessible and cleaner too read. I added code regions which lets you as a developer more easily fold code  and making it more legible. I also changed  some css class names to make  the purpose behind the code more clear. Finally I changed some of the HTML tags to be more semantic.
